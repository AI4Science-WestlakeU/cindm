# pytorch_net

This repository provides classes for 
- Efficient construction of neural networks with PyTorch, including multilayer perceptron (MLP), LSTM, CNN, WideResNet, model ensembles, etc.
- Easy manipulation of networks, including addition and removal of layers and neurons, training of networks, simplification of networks, loading and saving models as a dictionary. 
See [tutorial.ipynb](https://github.com/useruser/pytorch_net/blob/master/Tutorial.ipynb) for a simple demonstration.


## Requirements:
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) >= 0.4.1
